I'm Fluffinity, aka FLuffy, aka Fluff. I have been programming for the past 10 years, starting from high school throughout my bachelor in CS and
now at work. 
For 6 of these years I have also worked as a tutor at my university in many different courses. 
From introduction into programming, software development and programming languages 
to more theoretical ones like formal languages, computability, datastructures and efficient algorithms as well as 
performance oriented programming with GPUs, I was involved in a lot of stuff there. 
Doing this also gave me the perspective of how to actually teach these topics to others, something I was invested in even back in school.

Nowadays I work part-time as a student in security research while doing my master in IT-Security 
with the plan to upgrade to a full-time position once I finish my degree. 
Long term I want to combine these 2 aspect to really help others to stay secure out in the internet and to enable them to help others themselves.
This blog will be a part of this effort.

In case you want to know which languages I have used so far, here is the list:
- Java
- C
- C++
- Python
- C# (very out of date knowledge only. Maybe I should just write a Stardew Valley mod to get back up to speed)
- Scala
- Rust (partially outdated knowledge. The language moved very fast in terms of features)
- Zig

I have also briefly touch many others but these are the main ones. While I mostly liked the languages I worked with so far, 
I have very strong opinins about C++ in particular. Also, Zig for world domination! 

## Lets make the world a safer place together!
